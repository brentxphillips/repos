The Data Partners program was setup to identify and attempt to fill gaps in primarily IATI data where more detailed information is needed to train artificial intelligent applications and enable them to use IATI data to answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors.

After mapping reporting gaps in existing data, categorized by priority based on (potential uses of data in the field) current humanitarian informational needs in the field and potential data uses, Humanitarian AI community members will systematically reach out to and attempt to work with targeted humanitarian organizations to see aid activity information filling these gaps published to IATI or else provided to members to add to an AI training dataset.



The Data Partners program was setup to identify and attempt to fill gaps in primarily IATI data where more comprehensive information on aid activities is needed to train artificial intelligent applications how to use IATI data to answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors.

IATI is both a reporting standard, with hundreds of information fields and subfields humanitarian organizations can use to report aid activities, operational time frames, stakeholder relationships, transactions, results and etc in granular detail and a publishing framework  organizations can use to make the information openly accessible to machine applications. IATI is used today by over 1000 humanitarian organizations. It is mandated by many government development agencies and the United Nations is encouraging it’s wide spread use to help make humanitarian operations more transparent and data driven. To the tech community, IATI is a highly structured data soure…
Humanitarian AI community volunteers will analyze usage of IATI information fields and subfields, map data gaps and invite humanitarian organizations to join the Data Partners program to work with volunteers who will help them generate new IATI files or update existing files where needed to fill information gaps and make it easier for AI applications to traverse a cloned version of IATI’s entire dataset.
Initially the program will concentrate on addressing data gaps relevant to information needs prioritized by crisis needs today.

IATI is both a reporting standard, with over 500 elements and codes humanitarian organizations can use to report aid activities, operational time frames, stakeholder relationships, transactions, results and etc and a publishing conduit which organizations can use to make the information openly accessible to machine applications.
