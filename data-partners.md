# Data Partners Program

The Data Partners Program aims to engage and collect aid activity information from humanitarian organizations critically needed to train artificial intelligent applications. The program will concentrate on shepherding targeted organizations through the process of reporting specific aid activities in compliance with the IATI Standard to fill gaps in an informational matrix machine applications can traverse covering a wide range of operational scenarios.

## Problem

Humanitarian organizations are coalescing around using centralized repositories like the Humanitarian Data Exchange and reporting frameworks like IATI to openly share detailed information, creating machine accessible information sources artificial intelligent applications can plug into and use to answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors.

The IATI Standard contains over 500 elements and attributes humanitarian organizations can use to comprehensively detail aid activities, operational time frames, stakeholder relationships, transactions, results and etc. These fields are vitally important to artificial intelligent applications. They create digital nodes and relationships artificial intelligent applications can traverse, giving them the ability to break down and process raw information and queries.

Although IATI usage is growing exponentially, in part due to mandates issued by many government development agencies, organizations are collectively failing to comprehensively use IATIâ€™s full compliment of fields or to attache HXL hashtags to information stored in the Humanitarian Data Exchange to the degree needed to unlock machine data processing capabilities able to bring data usage to the next-generation. Lack of adequate reporting and tagging makes it difficult to use files to train, test and improve artificial intelligent applications and in turn incentive's greater reporting, stifling critical engineering work on algorithms and machine learning models.

## Program

This project aims to reach out to targeted humanitarian organizations and systematically collect information on key activities, inreasing information acessible to train and test artificial intelligent appliations.

Participating organizations will be shepherded through the process of reporting some number of their activities properly and using a wide variety of IATI information fields
