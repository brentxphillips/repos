Data Partners Program
The Data Partners program was setup to identify and fill gaps in primarily IATI data where more information on aid activities is needed to train artificial intelligent applications how to use data sourced from IATI to answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors.
Humanitarian AI members will analyze usage of IATI information fields, map data gaps and recruit humanitarian organizations to help fill gaps applicable to the program. Members will work with organizations to collect information on targeted aid activities, convert the information into machine readable XML code and then help organizations publish and channel the information through IATI.

Program Focus
The program is specifically interested in data streaming through IATI, an open data sharing framework setup by the humanitarian community that’s supported by the United Nations and mandated by many government development agencies. 
Ideal for AI, necessary for development
IATI and the Humanitarian Data Exchange are the largest and most active highly structured sources of detailed information on humanitarian aid activities openly accessible to machine applications.

IATI’s hundreds of standardized information fields form a vast matrix of nodes which artificial intelligent applications and popular digital assistants like Alexa, Cortana, Google and Siri can traverse to collect information to process for humanitarian actors



On a technical level, information spread across IATI’s hundreds of standardized information fields forms a vast matrix of cross-connecting nodes and relationships which artificial intelligent applications and popular digital assistants like Alexa, Cortana, Google and Siri can traverse to collect information to use to answer complex queries and return information of high operational relevance to humanitarian actors.
However organizations often fail to report activities in enough detail to make it easy to train, test and improve critical algorithms and machine learning models powering artificial intelligent applications.
