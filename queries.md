# Humanitarian Queries and Commands

![image](https://github.com/brentxphillips/repos/blob/master/smartdevice.png)

Developing intelligent algorithms and training machine learning models capable of **answering** complex queries posed by humanitarian actors and **returning** desired information of operational value requires extensive work.

This micro-project will generate an extensive list of humanitarian related **queries** and potentially executable **commands** for Humanitarian AI group members and others to use to help develop, train and test artificial intelligent applications.

## Sourcing Queries from Humanitarian Actors

The project will solicit queries and commands from humanitarian actors with expertise in a wide variety of thematic areas from a host of different organizations. Study participants will be asked to:

*	Reflect on their organization's mission, day-to-day operations, activities and many challenges and on needs in the field, ways of collaborating with other organizations and how greater information sharing can benefit all stakeholders;

*	Envision a popular digital assistant like an **Alexa** device on their conference table or **Siri** on their mobile phone connected, hypothetically, to vast sources of relevant information and the ability to carry out a range of conceivable actions;

*	List queries and/or commands they'd like in the future to be able to ask as a part of planning, executing or wrapping up an aid activity for example.


## Examples

For example, [MedShare]() and [Partners For World Health]() collect and donate medical supplies to aid organizations and health facilities around the world. Considering a humanitarian crisis and supplying medicines and medical equipment to local health facilities, staff from these organizations might like to ask an intelligent digital assistant the following:

### Queries

* What medical supplies are specifically needed within a general vicinity, where specifically and by which aid providers?
* Are any other medical suppliers planning or currently involved in responding to these needs, has anyone carried out similar activities in this vicinity recently, what aid did they collet and ship, via what routes where shipments made and what third parties facilitated or or exeuted these deliveries and what sorts of issues or complications arose?
* What supplies do MedShare ad Partners for World Health have warehoused, what supplies can they soure and how fast?
* How long would it take to get a shipment to it's desitination, what steps and time frames would be involved, how about for a shipment leaving in a week or a month?
* Who could organizations ideally collaborate to get medical suppies to where they're needed and how so, how about financially, which donors might be interested in helping

### Commands

* Send an inquiry to these potential partners, requistion supplies, send requests for more, reserve space on a cargo ship...

## Query Annotation

The project will generate two main sets of questions and commands, an initial minimalyy classified set and a more elaborate annotated set. The initial set will help spur ideas from study participants while the follow-up set will be used to research and develop ways of organizing, classifying and annotating queries and commands for AI training and testing use.

### Annotation

The project will experiment with organizing and annotating questions and commands and component keywords and phrases using humanitarian [cluser](https://emergency.unhcr.org/entry/61190/cluster-approach-iasc) catagories, [OECD-DAC](http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/dacandcrscodelists.htm) prupose codes and [AIdData](http://docs.aiddata.org/ad4/files/aiddata_coding_scheme_0.pdf) activity sub-codes as well as [HXL](https://hxlstandard.org/) hashtags, [IATI](http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/) elements and other taxonomy.

## Get Involved

Humanitarian actors, donors and other stakeholders interested in humanitarian AI applications and helping to advance the field are encourged to participate in this project and offer input. Likewise, Humanitarian AI community members and others are welcome to get involved. Contact: **team** (at) **humanitarianai.org** to join the project
