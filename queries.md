# Humanitarian Queries and Commands

![image](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/Humanitarian-Queries/blob/edit/Media/digital_assistant.png)

Developing intelligent algorithms and training machine learning models capable of **answering** complex queries posed by humanitarian actors and **returning** desired information of operational value requires extensive work.

This micro-project will generate an extensive list of humanitarian related **queries** and potentially executable **commands** for Humanitarian AI group members and others to use to help develop, train and test artificial intelligent applications.

## Sourcing Queries from Humanitarian Actors

The project will solicite queries and commands from humanitarian actors from a wide array of organizations. Study participants will be asked to:

* Reflect on their organization's mission, day-to-day operations, activities and challenges as well as needs in the field, ways of collaboratig with other organizations and how greater information sharing by organizations can be of use to everyone;

* Envision a popular digital assistant on their confernce table or installed on their mobile phone, hypothetically possessing vast relevant information and the ability to carry out a range of conceivable actions;

* List questions or commands they would like to make or might routinely make as a part of planning, executing and completing operations and follow-up questions and commands using this form [link]().

## Examples

For example, **MedShare** and **Partners For World Health** collect medical supplies for donation to aid organizations around the world. Staff from these organizations might list questions like these relvant to supporting health facilites struggling to provide aid in crisis zone:

* What medical supplies are specifically is needed within a general vicinity and where specifically and by which aid providers?
* Are any other mdical supply providers planning or currently involved in supplying these needs or supplied this vicinity recently, and what aid did they atually ship and via which route and what third parties were involved?
* What supplies do they have on heand to ship, what supplies can they soure and how fast?
* How long would it take to get the shipment to it's desitination, what steps and time framews would be involved, how about for a shipment leaving in a week or a month?
* Who could the supplier ideally collaborate with and how so, how about financially, which donors might be interested in helping
* Send an inquiry to these potential partners, requistion supplies, send requests for more, reserve space on a cargo ship...

## Query Annotation

The project will generate two main sets of questions and commands, an initial set with minimal classification and a tagged or annotated set. The initial set will help spur input from study participants and follow-up questions and help identify classifiable thematics. The second set will list questions and commands classified using OECD-DAC sector codes and activity codes created by AidData.

In addition to collecting questions, the project will undertake to classify questions based on relevant clusters and OECD-DAC purpose and AidData Activity Codes and add HXL hashtags

Tagging will help AI applications understand contextual relationships and generate follow-up questions

## Get Involved

Humanitarian actors, donors and other stakeholders are invited to participate in the project and share questions they would ideally like to pose emerging artificial intelligent applications as well as aid in question classification.
