# Data Partners Program

The **Data Partners** program was setup to **identify** and attempt to **fill** gaps in primarily **IATI** data where more comprehensive information on aid activities is needed to train artificial intelligent applications how to use IATI data to answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors.

**Humanitarian AI** members will **analyze** usage of IATI information fields, **map** data gaps and **recruit** humanitarian organizations to join the Data Partners program to help fill them. Volunteers will work with organizations to **collect** information on targeted aid activities, **convert** the information into machine readable XML code and then help organizations **report** the information to IATI or where applicable help organizations update information previously reported to IATI.

# Program Focus and Scope

The program is specifically interested in data streaming through IATI, the largest and most highly structured source of detailed information on humanitarian aid activities openly accessible to machine application. 



IATI is a formatting standard and information sharing channel created by the humanitarian community and supported by the United Nations
