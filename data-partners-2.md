# Data Partners Program

The **Data Partners** program was setup to **identify** and **fill** gaps in primarily **IATI** data where more comprehensive information on aid activities is needed to train artificial intelligent applications how to use IATI data to answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors.

**Humanitarian AI** members will **analyze** usage of IATI information fields, **map** data gaps and **recruit** humanitarian organizations to join the Data Partners program to help fill them. Volunteers will work with organizations to **collect** information on targeted aid activities, **convert** the information into machine readable XML code and then help organizations **report** the information to IATI or where applicable help organizations update information previously reported to IATI.

# Program Focus and Scope

The program is specifically interested in data streaming through **IATI**, an open data sharing channel setup by the humanitarian community that’s supported by the United Nations, mandated by a growing number of government development agencies and used today by over 1000 organizations. [IATI]() and the [Humanitarian Data Exchange]() are the largest, most active and highly structured sources of detailed information on humanitarian aid activities openly accessible to machine applications capable of powering emerging artificial intelligent applications.

IATI’s hundreds of standardized information fields are particularly important to the development and future of humanitarian AI applications. They create a matrix of cross-connecting nodes and relationships artificial intelligent applications and popular digital assistants like Alexa, Cortana, Google and Siri can traverse to collect information to answer complex queries and return information of high operational relevance to humanitarian actors.


# Work

The program is specifically interested in data streaming through IATI, an open data sharing channel setup by the humanitarian community and supported by the UNited Nations with hundreds of information fields organizations to use to report aid activities, transactions, results and other information. IATI is one of the largest, most active and highly structured sources of detailed information on humanitarian aid activities openly accessible to machine applications and emerging artivicial intelligent applications.
