# Data Partners Program

The **Data Partners** program was setup to **identify** and attempt to **fill** gaps in primarily **IATI** data where more comprehensive information on aid activities is needed to train artificial intelligent applications how to use IATI data to answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors.

**Humanitarian AI** members will **analyze** usage of IATI information fields, **map** data gaps and **recruit** humanitarian organizations to join the Data Partners program to help fill them. Volunteers will work with organizations to **collect** information on targeted aid activities, **convert** the information into machine readable XML code and then help organizations **report** the information to IATI or where applicable help organizations update information previously reported to IATI.
